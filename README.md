# You Found Me On GitHub

## Brief Intro

Thank you for email and interest. 

This page is not intended to sound rude, arrogant or unappreciative. It is just intended to save everyone a lot of time. Every so often I get emails that start something like this.

> We found you on GitHub and we believe you might be interested in...

The emails are generally light on content and I'm not sure whether the interest is genuine or it was sent by an HR bot. 

You have been sent to this repo to make everyone's life simpler.


## About Me

In case it was a bot this a bit about me. 

This is _not_ a CV, just a bit of recent detail that might help.

 - I am full stack developer
 - Part of what I do is consult for medium to large businesses to improve the workflow and business efficiency (using tech).
 - I have worked in the following industries: telecommunication, logistics, health, education, finance and even with funeral parlours 
 - I also coach software teams.

Currently this is my stack:
 - Node on the backend. I have used a bunch of other languages in the past, but I really like node.
 - Databases - whatever...
 - I quite like Vue on the front end - but I'm flexible
 - I use Appcelerator's Titanium for build apps (and have been for about the last 7 years)
 - I mostly using electron for Desktop
 - I generally deploy to Digital Ocean unless I am building an onsite integrated system.
 - For managing projects, I just fit-in with whatever the team is using

**REALLY IMPORTANT - I really like my setup as a freelancer so unless you want to discuss a contract, the offer will need to be incredible.**


## Non-negotiable bits
 - I will not relocate
 - I love remote working
 - I love the flexibility of freelance life
 - Options are not an incentive 
 - If you liked my GitHub profile and are impressed by my portfolio then I will not sit a technical interview. I don't have time for that and I am happy with what I'm doing. If are still interested, then I will be happy to chat informally which will be the one and only interview.

## Stuff I need to know

This sort of detail is generally missing from the email

 - What about my profile makes you think I'd be interested? This is a really important one. It lets me know a lot about you. (Failing to answer also lets me know a lot about you too…)
 - What is the salary package? You can keep it broad. Knowing this up front saves a lot of time too.
 - Now you know the non-negotiable bits – is it still relevant?
 - Would you consider a contract instead of permanent work?

## Final Bits

**IMPORTANT:** For future emails you must include: `We have read your "you-found-me-on-github".` in your email or you will be forwarded to this page. I know it sounds a rude, but I need to know you aren't a bot.

Thanks again for you email.

For other developers, feel free to fork and customise this repo. I think it will save everyone a lot of time!
